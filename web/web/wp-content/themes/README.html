		<h1><a href="http://dev.d10e.net/wordpress/">Tiny - a WordPress theme for minimalists</a></h1>
	</div>
	<div id="content">
		<h2>ReadMe for Tiny theme</h2>
		<p>This is a minimalist, single column, fixed-width theme for WordPress. You should
		unpack this in your <code>wp-content/themes</code> folder and select it in the admin
		panel.</p>

		<h3>Changing the header image</h3>
		<p>You get the Tiny theme header image with this package. It is recommended that you
		make your own header image, sized 330x140px and name it <code>tinyheader.jpg</code>
		and place it in the theme folder.</p>

		<h3>Plugins</h2>
		<p>This theme has code in place to use the <a href="http://dev.d10e.net/wordpress/">ComPreVal</a>
		(Comment Preview and Validation) plugin. I have also placed the code for the optional
		theme switcher in the sitemap. You only need to download, install and activate the
		plugin you want to use.</p>
		<p>If you think another plugin could be a good addition to this theme (keeping in mind
		this is a minimalist theme), please let me know and I will consider adding the
		necessary code.</p>

		<h3>Other customizations</h3>
		<p>I try to comment the stylesheet in a way that shows what is going on. It should be
		quite straightforward to make your changes to the stylesheet. Also the code for the
		theme itself is not very complicated. The only oddity is that there is no sidebar, and
		most of the functionality usually seen in the sidebar is now placed in the sitemap.</p>
		<p>If you need help with adjustments to the design, you can <a href="http://d10e.net/">hire
		me</a> to do so, or even to make you a separate design or theme to your specifications.
		I am a professional freelance web designer/developer who has bills to pay&#8230;</p>

		<h3>Further development</h3>
		<p>As the theme continues to be in development, certain details may change. I recommend
		you stay in tune with what's happening on <a href="http://dev.d10e.net/wordpress/">my
		WordPress development site</a>. If you find problems or shortcomings in this theme,
		please do not hesitate to tell me, so I can try to fix things.</p>
