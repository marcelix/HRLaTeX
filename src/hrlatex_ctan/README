* Description
=============

	This package simplifies creation of new documents for (average) croatian user.
	As an example - a class file hrdipl.cls (graduation thesis at the University 
	of Zagreb) and sample thesis documents are included.



* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:
	
	- Run LaTeX on the file `hrlatex.ins' to create the style file `hrlatex.sty'.
	- Run LaTeX on the file `hrlatex.dtx' to create the doc   file `hrlatex.dvi'.
	- Install these files anywhere you see fit. I recommend to do it locally 
	(current directory) for now.
